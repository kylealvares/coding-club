### Raspberry Pi Setup

At Coding Club, you'll learn to code using a variety of free, beginner-friendly tools. One of these is the **Raspberry Pi Foundation's Code Editor**, where you can program in **Python**, **HTML**, and **CSS** while completing exciting projects from the Raspberry Pi Projects site.

To save your projects, you'll need a **Raspberry Pi Foundation account**.  
- If you're **13 or older**, you can create your own account.  
- If you're **under 13**, ask a parent or guardian to set one up with you.

![Raspberry Pi Organization](/assets/raspberry-pi.png)

### How to Create Your Account

1. Go to [projects.raspberrypi.org](https://projects.raspberrypi.org).  
2. Click **Log in** in the top right corner.  
3. On the login screen, click **Create one** (bottom of the box).  
4. Select **Under 13**, if applicable.  
5. Enter your **parent's email** and create a **username** for your child (avoid using their real name).  
6. Complete the remaining fields and note the **username** and **password**.  
7. **Verify the account** using the email sent to the address provided.  

For more details, visit the [UAC Home > Coding Club](https://uac.churchcenter.com/calendar/event/204535151) page.  
Questions? Contact **Justin Hsu** at [justinh@uachome.org](mailto:justinh@uachome.org) or call [905‑477‑1554](tel:9054771554).

## Code of Conduct

<Steps>

### Be kind and respectful  
Treat everyone with kindness in your words, actions, and body language. Listen when others are speaking, avoid interrupting, and help create a welcoming environment for everyone.

### Use devices only for club activities  
Keep phones, tablets, and other devices put away unless they're needed for a club project. This helps everyone stay focused and shows respect for the leaders and your peers.

### Stay on approved websites  
Only use websites related to Coding Club activities or instructions. Staying on approved sites keeps everyone safe and focused on creativity and learning together.

</Steps>

By following these guidelines, we can make Coding Club a fun, respectful, and creative space for everyone.


## Helpful Tips

- Bring your laptop fully charged so you're ready to code right away.
- Arrive a few minutes before 5:00 PM so we can start on time.
- Review concepts from the previous week before class to stay confident and keep up.
- Ask questions, that's how we learn best!0:{"P":null,"b":"0vvu7_zDRMhCsuKa2vCtJ","c":["",""],"q":"","i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],[["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/coding-club/_next/static/chunks/eb5c892a473915d3.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/coding-club/_next/static/chunks/85e3901133d9a7cb.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-1",{"src":"/coding-club/_next/static/chunks/440c5c133ad92b8a.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-2",{"src":"/coding-club/_next/static/chunks/84b01388feef22eb.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-3",{"src":"/coding-club/_next/static/chunks/133a980807f66185.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}]],"$L2"]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"x:mx-auto x:flex x:max-w-(--nextra-content-width)","children":["$","$L3",null,{"value":[{"value":"Coding Club Information","id":"coding-club-information","depth":2},{"value":"Connecting to the Network","id":"connecting-to-the-network","depth":3},{"value":"Curriculum","id":"curriculum","depth":3},{"value":"Raspberry Pi Setup","id":"raspberry-pi-setup","depth":3},{"value":"How to Create Your Account","id":"how-to-create-your-account","depth":3},{"value":"Code of Conduct","id":"code-of-conduct","depth":2},{"value":"Be kind and respectful","id":"be-kind-and-respectful","depth":3},{"value":"Use devices only for club activities","id":"use-devices-only-for-club-activities","depth":3},{"value":"Stay on approved websites","id":"stay-on-approved-websites","depth":3},{"value":"Helpful Tips","id":"helpful-tips","depth":2}],"children":[["$","$L4",null,{}],["$","$L5",null,{"metadata":{"title":"Welcome to Coding Club","filePath":"app/page.mdx","timestamp":1768770928000},"bottomContent":"$undefined","sourceCode":"$6","children":["$L7","$L8"]}]]}]}],null,"$L9"]}],{},null,false,false]},null,false,false],"$La",false]],"m":"$undefined","G":["$b",[]],"S":true}
