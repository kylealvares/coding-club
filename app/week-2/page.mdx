## Definitions

### Instructions / Commands

Code is a set of instructions for the computer to follow. Each instruction tells the computer to do **one thing** at a time.

```python copy
print("Hello world")  # This tells the computer to show text
```

### Variables

Variables are containers that store information like text or numbers. You can give them names and use them later.

```python copy
name = "Alice"
age = 12
print(f"{name} {age}")
```

### Data Types

Different kinds of information are stored differently:

- **Strings** = text `"Hello"`  
- **Numbers** = integers or decimals `5`, `3.14`  
- **Booleans** = True/False `True`

```python copy
message = "Hi there!"
count = 5
is_happy = True
```

### Comments

Comments are notes for humans. The computer ignores them. In Python, start a comment with `#`.

```python copy
# This is a comment
print("Hello")  # This prints Hello
```

### Functions

Functions are blocks of code you can reuse. You “call” a function whenever you want the code to run.

```python copy
def greet():
    print("Hello!")

greet()  # Calls the function
```

### Print / Output

`print()` shows information on the screen. It's how you check what your code is doing.

```python copy
print("This is output!")
```

### Simple Math

Computers can calculate using Python operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.

```python copy
print(f"{5 + 3}")  # 8
print(f"{10 / 2}") # 5.0
```

### Order Matters

Computers follow instructions **line by line**, top to bottom. The order of your code affects the result.

```python copy
print("First line")
print("Second line")
```

## Modules

A **module** is a file that contains extra code you can use in your program. Modules let you use features that are already written, instead of creating everything from scratch.

Python comes with many **built-in modules**.

### Importing a Module

To use a module, you must **import** it first.

```python
import random
```

This gives your program access to everything inside the `random` module.

### Using a Module

After importing, you use the module name followed by a dot `.` and the function you want.

```python
import random

number = random.randint(1, 10)
print(number)
```

- `random.randint(1, 10)` gives a random number between 1 and 10  

### Another Example: Math Module

The `math` module provides useful math functions.

```python
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))   # 4.0
print(math.pi)         # 3.141592653589793
```

### Importing Only What You Need

You can import a specific part of a module instead of the whole thing.

```python
from datetime import datetime

current_time = datetime.now()
print(current_time)
```

This lets you use `datetime.now()` directly without writing `datetime.datetime.now()`.

Importing only what you need can make your code shorter and easier to read.

### Why Modules Matter

- Save time
- Keep code clean
- Use powerful tools easily
- Share code between programs

## Functions

A **function** is a named block of code that performs a task. Functions help you organize your code and reuse code instead of writing the same instructions again.

### Function Syntax

Functions in Python follow a specific structure:

```python
def function_name():
    # code inside the function
```

- `def` tells Python you are defining a function  
- `function_name` is the name you choose (use lowercase and underscores)  
- The parentheses `()` are required  
- The colon `:` tells Python the function code is starting  
- All lines inside the function must be **indented**

### Defining a Function

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")
```

This defines the function but does not run it yet.

### Indentation Matters

Python uses **indentation** to know which lines belong to a function.

```python
def show_message():
    print("This line is inside the function")
print("This line is outside the function")
```

Only the indented line runs when the function is called.

### Calling a Function

To run a function, write its name followed by parentheses.

```python
say_hello()
```

The code inside the function runs from top to bottom.

### Functions Can Have Multiple Lines

```python
def start_program():
    print("Program starting...")
    print("Loading...")
    print("Ready!")

start_program()
```

### Why Functions Are Useful

- Organize code  
- Reduce repetition  
- Make programs easier to read  
- Control when code runs  

Functions group instructions together so you can use them whenever you need.

## Input

In Python, you can ask the user for information using the `input()` function.  
Whatever the user types is stored as **text**.

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello {name}!")
```

- The message inside `input("...")` is shown to the user as a **prompt**  
- The value the user types is stored in a variable and can be used later  

### Inputting Numbers

Sometimes you want the user to enter numbers so your program can do calculations.  
Because `input()` always gives text, you must **convert** it first.

Use `int()` for whole numbers and `float()` for decimal numbers.

```python
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))
```

Now you can use the values in calculations:

```python
print(f"Next year, you will be {age + 1} years old.")
print(f"Your height times 2 is {height * 2}")
```

- `int()` converts text into a whole number  
- `float()` converts text into a decimal number  

<Callout type="warning">If the user types something that is not a number, Python will show an error.</Callout>
