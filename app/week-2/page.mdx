# Week Two

This guide introduces the very basics of coding using Python examples. It's perfect for someone just starting out!

## Definitions

### Instructions / Commands

Code is a set of instructions for the computer to follow. Each instruction tells the computer to do **one thing** at a time.

```python copy
print("Hello world")  # This tells the computer to show text
```

### Variables

Variables are containers that store information like text or numbers. You can give them names and use them later.

```python copy
name = "Alice"
age = 12
print(f"{name} {age}")
```

### Data Types

Different kinds of information are stored differently:

- **Strings** = text `"Hello"`  
- **Numbers** = integers or decimals `5`, `3.14`  
- **Booleans** = True/False `True`

```python copy
message = "Hi there!"
count = 5
is_happy = True
```

### Comments

Comments are notes for humans. The computer ignores them. In Python, start a comment with `#`.

```python copy
# This is a comment
print("Hello")  # This prints Hello
```

### Functions

Functions are blocks of code you can reuse. You “call” a function whenever you want the code to run.

```python copy
def greet():
    print("Hello!")

greet()  # Calls the function
```

### Print / Output

`print()` shows information on the screen. It's how you check what your code is doing.

```python copy
print("This is output!")
```

### Simple Math

Computers can calculate using Python operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.

```python copy
print(f"{5 + 3}")  # 8
print(f"{10 / 2}") # 5.0
```

### Order Matters

Computers follow instructions **line by line**, top to bottom. The order of your code affects the result.

```python copy
print("First line")
print("Second line")
```

## Input

In Python, you can ask the user for information using the `input()` function. Whatever the user types is stored as **text**.

```python copy
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello {name}!")
```

- The message inside `input("...")` is shown to the user as a prompt.  
- The value typed is stored in a variable for later use.

Sometimes, you want the input to be a number so you can do math. Use `int()` for whole numbers or `float()` for decimals:

```python copy
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))

print(f"Next year, you will be {age + 1} years old.")
print(f"Your height times 2 is {height * 2}")
```

- `int()` converts text to a whole number.  
- `float()` converts text to a decimal number.  

## Booleans

Booleans are special values that are either **True** or **False**. They help the computer decide what to do.

```python copy
is_happy = True
is_raining = False

print(f"Am I happy? {is_happy}")
print(f"Is it raining? {is_raining}")
```

- Booleans help the computer **decide what to do**.
- You often get booleans from **comparisons**.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators let you **compare values**. They return a boolean (`True` or `False`).

| Operator | Example  | Result | Meaning           |
| -------- | -------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| `==`     | `5 == 5` | True   | Equal to          |
| `!=`     | `5 != 3` | True   | Not equal to      |
| `>`      | `7 > 3`  | True   | Greater than      |
| `<`      | `2 < 4`  | True   | Less than         |
| `>=`     | `5 >= 5` | True   | Greater or equal  |
| `<=`     | `3 <= 4` | True   | Less or equal     |

## Conditionals

Conditionals let your program **make decisions** based on a value. The computer can run different code depending on conditions.

```python copy
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

if age >= 13:
    print(f"You can join the coding club!")
else:
    print(f"Sorry, you must be at least 13.")
```

- `if` checks a condition. If it is **True**, the indented code runs.  
- `else` runs when the `if` condition is **False**.  

You can also check multiple conditions using `elif`:

```python copy
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

if score >= 90:
    print(f"Excellent!")
elif score >= 70:
    print(f"Good job!")
else:
    print(f"Keep practicing!")
```

- Conditionals help your programs **respond differently** depending on what the user enters.  
- **Indentation matters** in Python; it shows which code belongs to each block.
