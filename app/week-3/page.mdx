# Week Three

This week we learn how to make our programs **think and decide** using
**booleans**, **comparisons**, and **conditionals**.

By the end of this lesson, your code will be able to respond differently based on user input.

## Review: Input & Conversion

### Input

You can use `input()` to ask the user for information.
Whatever the user types is stored as **text**.

```python copy
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello {name}!")
```

### Converting Input

If you want to work with numbers, you must convert the input first.

```python copy
age = int(input("Age: "))
print(f"Next year you will be {age + 1}")
```

- `int()` converts text to a whole number
- Without conversion, math will not work correctly

<Callout type="warning">
If the user types something that isn't a number, Python will show an error.
</Callout>

## Booleans

A **boolean** is a value that can be only:

- `True`
- `False`

Booleans are used to check conditions and make decisions.

```python copy
print(5 > 4) # True
print(3 > 10)# False
```

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean.

| Operator | Meaning| Example| Result |
|---------|------------------|----------|--------|
| `==`| Equal to | `5 == 5` | True |
| `!=`| Not equal| `5 != 3` | True |
| `>` | Greater than | `5 > 3`| True |
| `<` | Less than| `3 < 5`| True |
| `>=`| Greater or equal | `5 >= 5` | True |
| `<=`| Less or equal| `3 <= 5` | True |

Example in code:

```python copy
print(10 > 7)
print(4 == 9)
print(3 <= 3)
```

## Decisions in Real Life

Programs make decisions the same way humans do.

**Question:**
What should we wear based on the weather?

- If it's hot → t-shirt
- Else if it's cool → light jacket
- Else → heavy coat

Conditionals turn these ideas into code.

## Conditionals

**Conditionals** let your program make decisions.

Python uses:
- `if`
- `elif`
- `else`

### Basic If Statement

```python copy
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

if age >= 13:
print("You can join the coding club!")
```

- The code inside `if` runs **only if** the condition is `True`

### If / Else

```python copy
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

if age >= 13:
print("Welcome!")
else:
print("Sorry, you are too young.")
```

- `else` runs when the condition is `False`

### If / Elif / Else

Use `elif` to check **multiple conditions**.

```python copy
temp = int(input("What's the temperature (°C)? "))

if temp >= 25:
print("Hot! Wear shorts and sunscreen.")
elif temp >= 10:
print("Cool. Grab a light jacket.")
else:
print("Cold! Bundle up with a heavy coat.")
```

Python checks conditions **from top to bottom** and stops when it finds a match.

## Why Conditionals Matter

Conditionals allow your programs to:

- React to user input
- Make choices
- Behave differently in different situations
- Feel more interactive and intelligent

Almost every real program uses conditionals.

## Activity: Choose Your Own Adventure

Your goal is to build a **text-based choose your own adventure game**.

You must:
- Ask the user for input
- Convert **string input into an integer**
- Make **at least three decisions**
- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else`

**Bonus:**
- Use `randint()` to add randomness
- Use `datetime` to change the story based on time
