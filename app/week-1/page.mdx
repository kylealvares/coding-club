# Week One

This first project introduces key Python concepts: **print statements** to show output, 
**variables** to store data, and **functions** to organize code.

## Activity

In this first project, you'll learn some of the fundamental concepts of Python programming using the Raspberry Pi online Code Editor.

### Concepts you will explore

- **Print statements**: how to display text on the screen  
- **Variables**: how to store and use values in your program  
- **Functions**: how to group reusable pieces of code  

Before you begin, make sure everyone is **logged into their Raspberry Pi account** and the Code Editor is open.

Open the project at: 
   https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/editor-hello-world/editor

In this project, we'll explore **basic Python programming concepts**: variables, comments, print statements, and simple math.  

Here's the full code we'll work with:

```python copy
# imports
# This is a comment. Comments start with '#' and are ignored by Python.
# You can use them to explain your code or leave notes for yourself.

# variables
world = '🌎🌍🌏'       # Stores globe emojis
python = 'Python 🐍'   # Stores the word Python with a snake emoji
fire = '🔥'            # Stores a fire emoji
name = 'Shirley'       # Stores a person's name

# function definitions
# Another comment placeholder for functions. Functions are reusable blocks of code.

# Put code to run under here
print(f'Hello {world}')           # Prints "Hello 🌎🌍🌏"
print(f'Welcome to {python}')     # Prints "Welcome to Python 🐍"
print(f'{python} can also do math!')  # Prints "Python 🐍 can also do math!"
print(f'{5 * 10}')                # Prints the result of 5 * 10, which is 50
```

---

<Steps>
### Comments

- Comments start with `#`.  
- Python ignores them when running your code.  
- Use comments to **explain your code**, like:

```python copy
# This is a comment
x = 5  # This comment explains the variable x
```

---

### Variables

Variables are **containers that store information**.  

```python copy
world = '🌎🌍🌏'
python = 'Python 🐍'
fire = '🔥'
name = 'Shirley'
```

- `world` stores emojis.  
- `python` stores text with an emoji.  
- `fire` stores a fire emoji.  
- `name` stores a string representing a name.  

💡 Tip: Variables can store **text (strings)**, **numbers**, or other types of data.

---

### Print Statements

`print()` shows messages in the terminal.  

- We are using **f-strings** (`f'...'`) which let you insert variables directly:  

```python copy
print(f'Hello {world}')
```

This prints:  
```
Hello 🌎🌍🌏
```

Other examples:

```python copy
print(f'Welcome to {python}')
print(f'{python} can also do math!')
print(f'{5 * 10}')
```

Outputs:

```
Welcome to Python 🐍
Python 🐍 can also do math!
50
```

- Notice how `{5 * 10}` calculates inside the f-string automatically.
</Steps>

### Next Steps

- Change the values of the variables and see how the output changes.  
- Add more `print()` statements with your own emojis or math.  
- Try creating a simple message using your name and favorite emoji!
