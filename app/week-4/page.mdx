# Week Four

This week we learn how to **store multiple values** using **lists** and how to
**access, modify, and check items** inside them.

By the end of this lesson, your programs will be able to **remember more than one thing at a time**.

## Variables vs. Lists

### Single Variables

A variable stores **one value**.

```python copy
name = "Alex"
```

If we want to store more than one name, this doesn't work very well.

### Lists

A **list** stores **many values** in one variable.

```python copy
names = ["Alex", "Jordan", "Sam"]
```

## Creating Lists

Lists use **square brackets** `[]`.

```python copy
colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]
```

An empty list:

```python copy
items = []
```

<Callout type="info">
Lists keep items in order. The order matters.
</Callout>

## Indexing Lists

Each item in a list has a **position number** called an **index**.

<Callout type="important">
Indexes start at **0**.
</Callout>

```python copy
colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]

print(colors[0])  # red
print(colors[1])  # blue
print(colors[2])  # green
```

### Changing Items

```python copy
colors[1] = "yellow"
print(colors)
```

Result:
```
['red', 'yellow', 'green']
```

<Callout type="warning">
Using an index that doesn't exist will cause an error.
</Callout>

## List Length

Use `len()` to find how many items are in a list.

```python copy
numbers = [3, 7, 2]
print(len(numbers))
```

## Adding Items to a List

You can add new colors to a list using `append()`.

### `append()`

`append()` adds an item to the **end** of a list.

```python copy
colors = ["red", "blue"]
colors.append("green")
print(colors)
# ['red', 'blue', 'green']
```

After running this code:
- `"green"` is added to the end of the list
- The list now has **three colors**

### Using Input to Add a Color

You can also add a color using user input.

```python copy
colors = ["red", "blue"]

new_color = input("Enter a color to add: ")
colors.append(new_color)

print(colors)
```

<Callout type="info">
`append()` always adds the item to the end of the list.
</Callout>

## Comparing a List Item to a Value

You can compare a **specific item in a list** to a value using its **index**.

This lets your program make decisions based on **what is stored in the list**.

### Example: Checking a List Item

```python copy
colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]

if colors[0] == "red":
    print("The first color is red!")
```

In this example:
- `colors[0]` means **the first item**
- The program compares it to `"red"`
- If they match, the message prints

### Using Input with List Indexes

You can compare user input to an item in a list.

```python copy
answers = ["A", "B"]

choice = input("Choose A or B: ")

if choice == answers[0]:
    print("You chose A!")
elif choice == answers[1]:
    print("You chose B!")
```

### Comparing Numbers in a List

Lists can also store numbers.

```python copy
scores = [85, 92]

if scores[1] >= 90:
    print("High score!")
```

Here:
- `scores[1]` is `92`
- The condition checks if it is **greater than or equal to 90**

<Callout type="info">
Always make sure the index exists before comparing it.
</Callout>

## Classroom Example

```python copy filename="classroom.py"
# Make a list of fruits
fruitlist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Print the list out
print(fruitlist)

# Each item in the list has an "index" - which is it's position in the list
# In Python the index starts at 0, we acccess the item using square brackets and the position

# Examples:
# Print the first fruit in the list

# Print the second fruit in the list

# Print the third fruit in the list

# What happens if I try to access an item in position 4?

# How to add something at the end of the list?
fruitlist.append("orange")

# Print the entire list
print(fruitlist)

# Now try to acccess the item at position 4

# Print how many fruit are in the list
print(len(fruitlist))

# To use len() to access last item in the list
# print(fruitlist[len(fruitlist)-1])

```

## CYOA Template with Lists

```python copy filename="cyoa_template.py"
# Choose your Own Adventure Program
# Author: PUT YOUR NAME(S) HERE
# Date: PUT THE DATE HERE
import random

# Opening scene
print()
print(<DESCRIBE SCENE HERE>)
print('What do you do?')
choice1 = input('A: CHOICE1, B: CHOICE2')

# Choice1 = A
if (choice1 == 'A'):
    print(<DESCRIBE SCENE HERE>)
    choice2 = input('A: CHOICE1, B: CHOICE2')
# Choice2 = B
elif (choice1 == 'B'):
    print(<DESCRIBE SCENE HERE>)
    print('What do you do?')
    choice2 = input('A: CHOICE1, B: CHOICE2')

# Choice1 = A, Choice2 = A
if (choice1 == 'A' and choice2 == 'A'):
    print(<DESCRIBE SCENE HERE>)
# Choice1 = A, Choice2 = B
elif (choice1 == 'A' and choice2 == 'B'):
    print(<DESCRIBE SCENE HERE>)
# Choice1 = B, Choice2 = A
elif (choice1 == 'B' and choice2 == 'A'):
    print(<DESCRIBE SCENE HERE>)
# Choice1 = B, Choice2 = A
elif (choice1 == 'B' and choice2 == 'B'):
    print(<DESCRIBE SCENE HERE>)

print()
print('THE END')

## Use list to store messages to output to user at the end of the game ##
## Randomly output one ##
message_list = [<MESSAGE1>,<MESSAGE2>,<MESSAGE3>]
## I have 3 messages so generate an index between 0 and 2
ix = random.randint(0, 2)
## Print final message ##
print(message_list[ix])
```
