### Raspberry Pi Setup

At Coding Club, you'll learn to code using a variety of free, beginner-friendly tools. One of these is the **Raspberry Pi Foundation's Code Editor**, where you can program in **Python**, **HTML**, and **CSS** while completing exciting projects from the Raspberry Pi Projects site.

To save your projects, you'll need a **Raspberry Pi Foundation account**.  
- If you're **13 or older**, you can create your own account.  
- If you're **under 13**, ask a parent or guardian to set one up with you.

## Code of Conduct

<Steps>

### Be kind and respectful  
Treat everyone with kindness in your words, actions, and body language. Listen when others are speaking, avoid interrupting, and help create a welcoming environment for everyone.

### Use devices only for club activities  
Keep phones, tablets, and other devices put away unless they're needed for a club project. This helps everyone stay focused and shows respect for the leaders and your peers.

### Stay on approved websites  
Only use websites related to Coding Club activities or instructions. Staying on approved sites keeps everyone safe and focused on creativity and learning together.

</Steps>

By following these guidelines, we can make Coding Club a fun, respectful, and creative space for everyone.
