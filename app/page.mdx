# Welcome to Coding Club

Heard of **"Python"** before? Here's your chance to learn this versatile coding language! Youth will learn how to use variables, loops, and functions to create visual and interactive artwork, animations, simulations, games, and more.

This will be an amazing opportunity to learn useful skills outside of school, all while having fun and making friends!

## Code of Conduct

<Steps>
### Be kind and respectful of others
 
Treat everyone with kindness in your words, actions, and body language.
Listen when others are speaking, avoid interrupting, and make sure everyone feels welcome and included.
 
### Put away devices not used for club purposes
 
Keep phones, tablets, and other devices put away unless they are needed for a club activity.
This helps everyone stay focused, reduces distractions, and shows respect for the leaders and other students.

### Stay on club related websites
 
When using a device, only visit websites that are part of the club's activities or instructions.
Staying on approved sites keeps the environment safe and allows everyone to concentrate on learning and creating together.
