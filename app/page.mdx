### Raspberry Pi Setup

At Coding Club, you'll learn to code using a variety of free, beginner-friendly tools. One of these is the **Raspberry Pi Foundation's Code Editor**, where you can program in **Python**, **HTML**, and **CSS** while completing exciting projects from the Raspberry Pi Projects site.

To save your projects, you'll need a **Raspberry Pi Foundation account**.  
- If you're **13 or older**, you can create your own account.  
- If you're **under 13**, ask a parent or guardian to set one up with you.
